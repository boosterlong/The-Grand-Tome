# The Grand Tome

Hey! Thanks for checking out my code for The Grand Tome. This is a fun little playground of mine to learn Rails with a goal of having a function DM tool.

## Currently the only services it provides is:
* A blog-like posting area for quests, including a comments section for notes.
* A sticky-note-esque posting area for items. This is slightly more front facing and aimed at linking specific items to your players.

* Ruby version = 3.0.0
* Rails version 6.1.1
